## Installation

Add your own forecast.io api key inside `index.coffee`. You can get yours here: https://developer.forecast.io. Make sure not use TextEdit to modify the file, since it is known to break the widget. If you do want to use TextEdit, make sure to uncheck 'smart quotes' in the TextEdit preferences before editing.

To get the same font as on the screenshot you can download the great Berlin font by Antonio Rodriges. http://antoniorodriguesjr.com/fonts.html
