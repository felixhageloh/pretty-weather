# Notes

Replace <api-key> inside `index.coffee` with your own forecast.io api key. You can get yours here: https://developer.forecast.io. You also need to enter your lat/lon coordinates, which you can find using google maps for example.

To get the same font as on the screenshot you can download the great Berlin font by Antonio Rodriges. http://antoniorodriguesjr.com/fonts.html
